Commitlint is used to have a common way of writing commit messages. `Conventional Commits` extension could help with that.

Basic structure of commit message: `type(scope): title`

`type` can be: [build, chore, ci, docs, feat, fix, perf, refactor, revert, style, test].

`scope` is a task number from jira - like AL-9999.
